If you don’t want to use Java, you have the option of just downloading and extracting the ZIP release. Try this especially if you don’t have much experience with programming or test-automation. We recommend that you use the [Karate extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=karatelabs.karate) - and with that, JavaScript, .NET and Python programmers will feel right at home.

## Code Coverage for non-Java Projects
This has been demonstrated for JavaScript by [Kirk Slota](https://twitter.com/kirk_slota). You can find a working sample here: [karate-istanbul](https://github.com/kirksl/karate-istanbul) - and you can read the discussion at Stack Overflow for more details.

You should be able to use the same approach for other platforms. Note that there are plenty of ways to start a Karate test via the command-line, such as the standalone JAR.
